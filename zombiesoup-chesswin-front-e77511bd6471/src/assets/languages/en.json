In addition to these methods, we have a sophisticated software module (the Artificial Intelligence module) that detects violations of the FAIRPLAY rules. At the time of discovery of such a user, ChessWin has the right to suspend this user without warning. The platform also ensures that selected opposing players have roughly the same rank. This means that a strong player (who has a high rating) will get an opponent / will play with a player of the same strength category and with a similar rating.
